# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git or Global Information Technology is a type of technology that everyone uses in our everyday lives it stores information in a cloud basically. Github however allows users mostly coders and engineers to access that technology and information through branchs from a remote(git) to a local(your device) and we can easily make changes and edit files through different branches almost like a tree branching off from the main trunk. So basically git is the technology and GitHub is the location to save and access things. I have used Git and Github personally while creating .js, .html, .md, and .css files in our Cohorts repositories. We access these files through the terminal and creating branchs to edit them, sending them back to the remote, and creating pull requests.

Researched answer: Git is an open source DevOps tool that allows you to manage and keep track of your source code history. Allowing multiple developers to easily and efficiently edit files together. GitHub is a cloud based service that lets developers manage Git repositories

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Several JavaScript operators will allow you to return a Boolean value. Those operators are >, <, ==, ===, >=, <=. All of these operators compare two values together and return a boolean value. I have used these operators when creating conditional statements which allows the computer to make decisions based on the outcomes of these Boolean operators. If true do this code block, if false continue making decisions until output is true.

Researched answer: The greater than >, less than <, greater than or equal too >=, less than or equal to <= are all relational operators which result in a true or false answer. Equality operators include the loose equality == and the strict equality === operators. So far all of these were mentioned above the only ones i forgot to mention were the logical operators. && the and operator, || or operator, and ! the bang operator.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Indexs are like old recipe cards, all written and organized on cards in a little file. The index how ever is what place the card or "Apple Pie Recipe" is in the order of cards. While a value is assigned to a variable like const let or var. I have used both of these in my code so far. Indexs have been used when trying to access a specific place in an array or trying to find what is in the [3] place in an array. I have also used values when assigning variables to a string, set of numbers, or another variable that i am trying to changing using a built in method.

Researched answer: Index is a way to pull out a select set of values from an array. The index of a value in an array is that value's location within the array. There is a difference between the value and where the value is stored in an array. Values are values assigned to eather Booleans, Strings, arrays, numbers, etc.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the amount of times something will happen or repeat and when it will stop. I have used iteration when creating for loops. In the beginning () there are three steps that need to be done before the loop will work. What number is the loop starting at, the iteration or how long the loop will run for, and how it increments or decrements.

Researched answer: iteration definition "the repetition of a process or utterance." Loops allow programs to perform repetative tasks without repeating themselves such as iterating through an array.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: One person is the driver while the other person is the navigator. The drivers responsibility is to have their hands on whatever they are working on at the time and is basically the one doing the work, while the navigator is checking for mistakes, repeating instructions and providing helpful tips along the way. The navigator is not hands on working. I have had several good pair programming partners and expierences one for example was with Don I was struggling with the terminal so he said I should drive first and he would walk me through it and help me if I ran into problems.

Researched answer: "Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently." It was created from an agile software development framework named Extreme Programming (XP) aimed to give more improved software.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: "Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them"

2. Jest: "Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly"

3. Objects: "Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key: value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior."

4. Method: "JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition"

5. Classes: "Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects. Just like functions, classes have their own scope."
